# MVC Proxy
This project aims at creating a lightweight MVC middleware, to generate a schema containing typeinformation, for all action methods in a MVC project. The schema holds information, for a compiler, to generate a client proxy.
At this time, there is no compiler target, but I will code a POC that generates a proxy module for the browser, using window#fetch to execute MVC actions.
